# `mkdocs_rich_argparse` developer documentation

If you're looking for user documentation, go [here](README.md).

## Development install

```shell
# Create a virtual environment, e.g. with
python -m venv env

# activate virtual environment
source env/bin/activate

# make sure to have a recent version of pip and setuptools
python -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools

# (from the project root directory)
# install mkdocs_rich_argparse as an editable package
python -m pip install --no-cache-dir --editable .
# install development dependencies
python -m pip install --no-cache-dir --editable .[dev]
# install documentation dependencies only
python -m pip install --no-cache-dir --editable .[docs]
```

Afterwards check that the install directory is present in the `PATH` environment variable.

## Running the tests

There are two ways to run tests.

The first way requires an activated virtual environment with the development tools installed:

```shell
pytest -v
```

The second is to use `tox`, which can be installed separately (e.g. with `pip install tox`), i.e. not necessarily inside the virtual environment you use for installing `mkdocs_rich_argparse`, but then builds the necessary virtual environments itself by simply running:

```shell
tox
```

Testing with `tox` allows for keeping the testing environment separate from your development environment.
The development environment will typically accumulate (old) packages during development that interfere with testing; this problem is avoided by testing with `tox`.

### Test coverage

In addition to just running the tests to see if they pass, they can be used for coverage statistics, i.e. to determine how much of the package's code is actually executed during tests.
In an activated virtual environment with the development tools installed, inside the package directory, run:

```shell
coverage run
```

This runs tests and stores the result in a `.coverage` file.
To see the results on the command line, run

```shell
coverage report
```

`coverage` can also generate output in HTML and other formats; see `coverage help` for more information.## Running linters locally

For linting and sorting imports we will use [ruff](https://beta.ruff.rs/docs/). Running the linters requires an
activated virtual environment with the development tools installed.

```shell
# linter
ruff check .

# linter with automatic fixing
ruff check . --fix
```

To fix readability of your code style you can use [yapf](https://github.com/google/yapf).

### (3/3) GitHub
